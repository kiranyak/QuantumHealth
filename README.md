# QuantumHealth

Application:

Our goal is to create a jupyter interface webapplication that is able to analyze biological data coming from cells, molecules, or viruses.
Data from sample is initially obtained as a string of zeroes and ones where:

zeroes :  healthy
ones: unhealthy

Our application will identify the location of unhealthy position in the data which will then mapped as a unhealthy position in samples (cells, molecules or viruses). The identification will be done using Quantum Algorithms and AI which in theory is exponentially fast than its corresponding classical friends. 

Example:

Step 1: Get the data from samples in the form of [000000100]
Step 2: Input this data and find out the position of "1" using quantum algorithm. Here position of 1 is: 6.
Step 3: Display the data, quantum circuits, graphs for the users.

Data is
